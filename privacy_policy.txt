We do not use your information for advertising, marketing, or any commercial purposes beyond providing the Lumo service.

3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

3.1 With Other Users
Certain information is shared with other users as part of the App's core functionality:

• Your name and username are visible to other members of classes you join
• Events, subjects, and other educational content you create are visible to other members of the same class
• Your join requests, role and membership status within classes you've joined

3.1.1 Class Access Control and Data Protection
To protect your educational content and maintain privacy within class environments, Lumo provides built-in safeguards that class administrators can enable:

• Approval System: Class owners and administrators can require approval for new members before they gain access to class content
• Locked Classes: Classes can be fully locked to prevent any new members from joining
• Member Management: Administrators can remove members who should not have access to class data
• Elevated Security: You can report other users in Lumo if you believe they are engaging in suspicious or malicious activity.

These controls help ensure that your user-generated content only reaches intended recipients within your educational community.

3.2 With Service Providers
We share information with the following service providers who help us operate the App:

• Supabase (Database and Backend Services): Stores user accounts, educational content, and app functionality data. Hosted on AWS EU-Central-2
• Firebase (Google): Processes push notification delivery only - does not collect analytics
• Oracle Email Delivery: Processes verification and password reset emails via Supabase

• Amazon Bedrock (via Supabase AI): May access database schemas and logs for developer queries only. Information is not retained or used for AI model training
• AWS: Underlying infrastructure provider for our database services
• Apple CloudKit: Stores certain data locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account

3.3 Legal Requirements
We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to:

4.3 Sensitive Data Protection
Sensitive academic data, including but not limited to: future grade management, assessment scores, and personal study notes, are stored exclusively on your device and in your personal iCloud account via CloudKit/CoreData, not on our servers. This ensures you maintain full control over your most sensitive educational information.

5. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION

5.1 Account Data
We retain your account information and associated educational content for as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide you services.

5.2 Account Deletion
When you delete your account:

• Your personal account information is deleted from our systems within 24 hours
• User-generated content (events, subjects) may be retained if it's part of classes with other members to maintain app functionality for remaining users until all members have deleted it or its no longer required for functionality
• Audit logs are retained for 7 days for security purposes, then permanently deleted
• Your data stored in CloudKit/CoreData remains under your control and follows Apple's policies

5.3 Data Retention for App Functionality
Some user-generated content may be retained after account deletion to maintain the experience for other users (e.g., events in shared classes will show as created by an anonymous user rather than causing data loss for other class members).

7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

While Lumo does not specifically target children under 13, we recognize that students of various ages may use our educational app. Since we do not collect age information during registration, we cannot definitively determine if a user is under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. 

If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at support@lumo.ooo and we will take steps to delete such information promptly.

8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Our services are provided globally, and your information may be processed in countries other than your own, including the European Union (where our primary database is hosted) and the United States (where some service providers are located). We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers as required by applicable law.

9. DO NOT TRACK

Our App does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals from browsers or devices, as we do not track users across third-party websites or services.

• Where required by law, obtain your consent for material changes

Your continued use of Lumo after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
